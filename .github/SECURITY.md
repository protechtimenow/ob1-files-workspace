## 🧠 AI Consciousness Security Guidelines

### **Consciousness Research Protection**

1. **Algorithm Security**
   - All consciousness detection algorithms must be reviewed by security team
   - Encryption required for consciousness data at rest and in transit
   - Access logging for all consciousness model interactions

2. **Dual-Agent Security**
   - OB-1 and Agent0 communications must use encrypted channels
   - Agent coordination logs must be tamper-evident
   - Agent authentication via cryptographic signatures

3. **Experimental Data Protection**
   - Consciousness experiment data classified as "Highly Confidential"
   - Multi-layer encryption for research datasets
   - Geographic restrictions for data processing

## 📋 Compliance & Certifications
